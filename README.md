## Description

"Brain Games" is a collection of five console games built on the principles of popular brain-training mobile applications. Each game presents questions that require correct answers. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Incorrect answers terminate the game and offer the option to start over. The games are:

- Even or Odd: Determining whether a number is even or odd.
- Calculator: Arithmetic expressions that need to be evaluated.
- Greatest Common Divisor: Finding the largest common divisor of two numbers.
- Progression: Finding the missing numbers in a sequence of numbers.
- Prime Number: Determining whether a number is prime.
